Java Vatiables:

  String - stores text, such as "Hello". Sting values are surrounded by double quotes
    String myText = "Hello";
    
  int - Stores inegers (whole nubmers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
    int myNum = 5;
    
  float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
    float myFloatNum = 5.99f;
    
  char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
    char myLetter = 'D';
    
  boolean - stores values with two states: true or false
    boolean myBool = true;


Data types are divided into two groups:

  - Primitive data types - includes byte, short, int, float, double, boolean and char 
  - Non-primitive data types - such as String, Arrays and Classes
  
  
Primitive Data Types

A primitive data type specifies the size and type of variable values, and it has no addtional methods.

There are eight primitive data types in Java:

  byte - 1 byte - stores whole number from -228 to 127
  short - 2 bytes - stores whole number from -32,768 to 32,767
  int - 4 bytes - stores whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
  long - 8 bytes - stores whole numbers from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
  float - 4 bytes - stores fractional numbers, Sufficient for storing 6 to 7 decimal digits
  double 8 bytes - stores fractioanal nubmers, Sufficient for storing 15 decimal digits
  boolean 1 bit - stores true or false values
  char 2 bytes - stores a single character/letter or ASCII values
  
  Numbers
  
  Primitive number types are divided into two groups:
  
    - Integer types stores whole numbers, positive or negative (such as 123 or -456), whthought decimals. Valid types are byte, short,         int and long. 
    
    - Floating point types represents numbers with a fractional part, containing one or more decimals. There are two types: float and
      double.

  
  




parsInt() --  Method convert String to Integer
indexOf() -- Method returns the position of the first occurence of specified character(s) in a string
lastIndexOf() -- Method to return the position of the last occurence of specified character(s) in a string
charAt() -- Method that returns the character at the specified index in a string, the index of the first character is 0, the second 1 etc
replaceAll() -- Method that replaces each substing of the sting that matches the given regular expression with the given replacement
println() -- Method is often used to display variables. To combine text and a variable, use the + character.
